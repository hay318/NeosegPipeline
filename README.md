#NeoSegPipeline

##What is it?

This tool allows segmenting neonate brain MRI using a subject-specific atlas. It generates an subject-specific atlas based on an atlas population and some diffusion images of the subject to segment. Then we run a single atlas method with this atlas and obtain some good results, especially for in subcortical midbrain structure.
